        started working as an Macintosh IT-Consultant in 2012. Once in a week a
        used to ride as a bike messenger for several years. In October 2020 I
        participated at a 3 month remote Coding Bootcampe in Cologne. The result
        out if this 3 Months (and of course the experience I gained before), led
        to an App called -=DispoDisco=-. It was done by @domko95 and me.
